## Rules

An interogator is facing all other player. It's him versus them. Who will be humiliated and who will outsmart the other ?

Every participent except the interogator must enter a secret random and fun Wikipedia article that he or she has read previously.

At the begining of the game, the interogator select at random the title of an entered Wikipedia article.

By asking some question to each other player, he must found out who really read the article and who is making it up on the fly.
